# Final-Project
In this project we sought out to make a radio.
We accomplished this and we attached a display to it.
The following code is what controlls the display and buttons.

The buttons allow the user to select diffrent options on the menue.
The potentiometers allow for the user to switch between stations
and adjust the volume.
While the user adjusts these parameters this information is displayed 
on the LCD screen.
This data is also sent to our ThingSpeak channel
